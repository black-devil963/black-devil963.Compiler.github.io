calling External Api in angular :1)Get method
                                 2)Get method with parameter
                                 3)post method
                                 
                                        1)Get method
so for making any Http request we have to first import HttpClientModule in app.module.ts 
After that we will make a service to call an external api for which we will  be create a freeapi.service.ts file
In freeapi.service.ts file we will import injectable from angular core  after which we will declare a class named as freeApiService of type injectable
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
@Injectable()
export class freeApiService/*freeApiService is a service that we are going to inject in other component */
{

}
we are going to use an external api 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1/comments' which is get Api that returns  json in form of list with fiels like postId,Id,name,email & body
to do so we will create a folder called class inside which we will create a 'comment.ts' file   which will replicate all fields of Api
Now lets go to freeApiService and create a method that will able to make get request 
Now we have to import our service to app.module.ts 
Now its time to call the service from app.component.ts file
                                 
                                        2)Get method with parameter
we are going to use an external api 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?userId=value' which is get Api with parameter that returns  json in form of list with fiels like userId,Id,title & body     
we will be creating a class 'getwithparameter' to replicate this field                    
Now lets go to freeApiService and create a method that will able to make get request with parameter             
Now its time to call the service from app.component.ts file
                                        
                                        3)post method
we are going to use an external api 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts' which is post Api that takes jslon list containing value for userId,title & body  and returns  id,userId,title & body as result
                 
Now lets go to freeApiService and create a method that will able to make post request with parameter             
Now its time to call the service from app.component.ts file
import getwithparameter inside freeApi.service.ts
